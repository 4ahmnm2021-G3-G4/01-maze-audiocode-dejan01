# 01-maze-audiocode-dejan01

### Project description: 
This proejcts is about to find a sack that weighs 10kg in order to leave the maze. A scale was placed next to the exit door, where the player can check the weight of the sack. If the 10kg Sack was placed, the exit door will open. 

### Development platform: 
MacOs: Big Sur 11.2.3, Game Engine: Unity 2019.1.14f1, Visual Studio Code 1.57.1, Steam,  
SteamVR 2.5.0 (https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases/tag/2.5.0)

Note on Unity Version 2019.1.14f1 and SteamVR: The SteamVr plugin has many issues when used with Unity Versions > 2019.1.3 because the XR Management System changed from 2019.1.3 to 2019.1.4. Valve is working on it, so we will use these older versions for the VR programming.  
Download steamvr_2_5_08_19.unitypackage, import the package: Assets --> Import Package --> Custome Package

## Software/Hardware Requirements: 
Unity hardware requirements https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.1/Documentation/Manual/system-requirements.html 
Oculus hardware requirements https://support.oculus.com/248749509016567/
Steam has to be installed
SteamVR has to be installed
You need a VR headset in this case an Oculus Rift

First open Oculus software, second open SteamVR (or start game from unity), otherwise some strange errors will happen.
